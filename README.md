## Background


Hindu spiritual practice has long been a part of daily life, offering mental peace, discipline, and a connection with the divine. Traditionally, pooja routines were passed down through families, with elders guiding younger generations in rituals, mantras, and spiritual understanding.

In modern times, however, urban lifestyles, busy schedules, and nuclear families have reduced this transfer of knowledge. Many people feel spiritually inclined but don’t know how to begin. Available guidance is often complex, scattered, or assumes prior experience—making it overwhelming for beginners.

As a result, there is a clear need for a simple, structured, and beginner-friendly pooja routine that provides clarity and builds consistency.

Key Challenges Today

Lack of clear guidance – Many want to perform daily pooja but don’t know the correct steps.

Overly complex instructions – Traditional procedures can feel lengthy and technical.

Decline in family-based learning – Spiritual knowledge is no longer consistently passed down.

Inconsistent practice – Without a simple routine, regular discipline is hard to maintain.

Modern stress and anxiety – People seek structured spiritual practices for inner calm.

No clear starting point – Beginners need a foundation before deepening their practice.

This initiative addresses these challenges by offering a practical and accessible entry into daily spiritual practice.

## How Common Is This Problem?

This is a widespread challenge, especially among:

* Young adults living away from family
* Busy working professionals
* People reconnecting with spirituality later in life
* Individuals in urban or modern environments
* Members of the Hindu diaspora worldwide

Millions of people feel spiritually inclined but lack access to simple, beginner-friendly guidance. As traditional family-based teaching declines, this gap continues to grow.

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%
