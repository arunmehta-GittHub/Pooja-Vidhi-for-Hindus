## Background

Background

Hindu spiritual practice has traditionally been an integral part of daily life, providing mental peace, discipline, and a sense of connection with the divine. For centuries, pooja (worship) routines were passed down through families, with elders teaching younger generations how to perform daily rituals, chant mantras, and develop spiritual awareness.

However, in modern times, rapid urbanization, busy lifestyles, nuclear families, and reduced transmission of traditional knowledge have created a gap. Many individuals feel drawn toward spirituality and want to follow a daily pooja routine, but they do not know where or how to begin. Available information is often complex, scattered, or assumes prior knowledge, which makes it difficult for beginners.

As a result, there is a need for a simple, structured, beginner-friendly pooja routine that provides clarity, builds consistency, and allows individuals to gradually deepen their spiritual practice.

Lack of clear guidance for beginners
Many people want to perform daily pooja but do not know the correct steps or sequence.

Overwhelming and complex traditional instructions
Most available pooja procedures are lengthy, technical, and difficult for beginners to follow.

Loss of traditional knowledge transfer
Earlier, spiritual practices were taught by elders, but this is less common today.

Inconsistency in spiritual practice
Without a simple routine, people struggle to maintain regular spiritual discipline.

Mental stress and lack of inner calm
Modern lifestyles create stress, anxiety, and restlessness, and people seek structured spiritual practices for peace.

Difficulty in building a personal spiritual foundation
Beginners need a starting point before developing deeper, personalized practices.

How Common or Frequent Is This Problem?

This problem is very common, especially among:

Young adults living away from family

Working professionals with busy schedules

People rediscovering spirituality later in life

Individuals living in urban or modern environments

Members of the Hindu diaspora worldwide

Millions of Hindus feel spiritually inclined but lack access to simple, beginner-friendly guidance. This gap continues to grow as traditional family-based learning declines.

Personal Motivation

The motivation behind this idea comes from observing that many sincere individuals want to follow a spiritual path but feel confused, hesitant, or intimidated by complex rituals. There is a clear need for a simplified, structured starting point that removes fear and uncertainty.

Spiritual practice should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their prior knowledge. Providing a clear and simple pooja routine helps individuals build confidence, consistency, and a personal connection with spirituality.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```
